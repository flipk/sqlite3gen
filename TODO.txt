- finish blob decoding in xml decoder
- add type="" validation in xml decoder
- lots of error logging in xml encoder and decoder
- maybe xml encoder can fancy-indent?

- need a strategy for rolling back to older schema versions
  (if you upgrade software, then fall back, old software won't
   know how to reverse the modifications; maybe tables can be
   renamed and archived using a well known convention so at least
   it could load a copy of the old database which does not contain
   updates made while on the new software?)
