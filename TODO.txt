- add type="" validation in xml decoder
- stop mixing underscores and CamelCaps in the API, boo
- make protobuf and xml support optional in sqlite3gen
- support stupid "cpp" files in Makefile.inc
- subscriptions to updates?

- custom query type needed for things like 'select unique',
  maybe a way to specify the full sql query with column
  names and where-clause?
