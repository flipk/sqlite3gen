- serious bug in xml parser: table name and field name
  cannot be the same because it can't handle nested tags
  of the same name.
     - write a new xml parser that processes serially and
       recurses as it goes, rather than searching for the
       closing tag right after finding the opening tag.

- add type="" validation in xml decoder
- lots of error logging in xml encoder and decoder
- maybe xml encoder can fancy-indent?

- custom query type needed for things like 'select unique',
  maybe a way to specify the full sql query with column
  names and where-clause?
